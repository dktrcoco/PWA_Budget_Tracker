## Story

AS AN avid traveller I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

## Install

Being a Heroku-deployed application, there is no installation required for the user.

Being open-source, if someone wants to dig into the nuts and bolts of this application, simply clone the repo and use the CLI to install the necessary node module packages/dependencies

It should be noted that this application utilizes MongoDB, so this should be installed separately prior to running/testing this application locally.
