## Story

AS AN avid traveller I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

GIVEN a user is using this Heroku-deployed Budget App

WHEN there is no internet connection

THEN any user input (withdrawal or deposit) will be displayed and added to their transaction history when their connection is back on

## Install

Being a Heroku-deployed application, there is no installation required for the user.

Being open-source, if someone wants to dig into the nuts and bolts of this application, simply clone the repo and use the CLI to install the necessary node module packages/dependencies

It should be noted that this application utilizes MongoDB locally (MongoDB Atlas for Heroku Deployment Use), so this should be installed separately prior to running/testing this application locally.
